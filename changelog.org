* Changelog
List of user-visible changes that have gone into each release

** 3.10.1 (Unreleased)
- JSON parsing is always strict. See [[file:README.org::*Incrementally%20JSON%20Parsing][README#Incrementally JSON Parsing]]. Requires cheshire > 5.9.0.
** 3.10.0
- Add trust-manager and key-managers support to the client
  https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/pull/469
- Improving consistency of connection option names
  https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/pull/483
  https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/issues/477
- Ensure Socket Timeout is set for BasicHttpClientConnectionManager
  https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/pull/463
- Reduce body allocation and copying
  https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/pull/475
** 3.9.1
- Fix body parsing when first byte value is 255
  https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/pull/449
- Add custom =:unexceptional-status= option
  https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/pull/451
** 3.9.0
- Add support for reusable http clients, returning the client in =:http-client= and allowing one to
  be specified (with the same setting) - https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/issues/441
- Cancelling the =Future= returned from an async http request now also aborts the HttpRequest object
- Async connection managers no longer put the connection manager in an illegal ACTIVE state [[https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/issues/443][#443]]
- Added the =:cookie-spec= and =:cookie-policy-registry= options for specifying a custom cookie spec
  for parsing cookies. Since clj-http doesn't rely on Apache's cookies handling, this is for
  advanced users who wish to add their own cookie validation, or use Apache's handling instead of
  clj-http's. It also allows a user who wants to registry a custom spec to reuse the spec without
  creating it for every request. Semi-related to https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/issues/444
- Added support for caching HTTP responses from a server. This can dramatically speed up requests to
  the same URL. Filling and invalidating the cache is handled by Apache's httpclient-cache project,
  with configuration exposed under the =:cache= and =:cache-config= parameters in the option map.
  https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/issues/445

** 3.8.0
- Reintroduce the =:save-request= and =:debug-body= options
- +Wrap nested querystring params before form params, fixing
  https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/issues/427+ Reverted, see further below
- Merged https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/pull/426 to allow an empty SSLGenericSocketFactory
  context
- Merged https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/pull/424 to add :mime-subtype request parameter to
  override mime subtype
- create-multipart-entity with three arguments arity lets the selection of =HttpMultipartMode=
- new request key :http-multipart-mode which is HttpMultipartMode/STRICT by default
- Added =:ignore-nested-query-string=, =:flatten-nested-form-params=, and =:flatten-nested-keys=
  options for finer-grained control over which nested parts of the request are flattened. Fixes
  https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/issues/427
- Added =:http-builder-fns= and =:async-http-builder-fns= to support arbitrary customizations to the
  =HttpClientBuilder= and =HttpAsyncClientBuilder=
- Fixed an issue where redirects to a bad location could cause the async client to hang -
  https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/pull/435
- =client/parse-url= now includes the original URL in the =:url= key
- =core/get-cookie-policy= is now a multimethod. This allows users to customize the return of their
  own cookie validation method.
- Empty responses with coercion no longer throw exceptions when processing empty gzipped response
  streams. Fixes https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/issues/257
